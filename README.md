### Hey, internet traveler! 👋

I'm a frontend developer who turns caffeine into clean, snappy, and ridiculously smooth web experiences.  
If it's **fast**, **accessible**, and **a joy to use**, I probably built it (or refactored it because, let’s be honest, past me could’ve done better).  

### 🚀 What I do:  
💡 **Make the web prettier**—but in a smart, functional way.  
⚡ **Chase pixel perfection** (within reason, I’m not *that* obsessive… or am I? 🤔).  
🎨 **Mess with React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Sass** until they behave.  
🔍 **Spot bad UI/UX** like a detective spotting plot holes in a bad movie.  

### 🛠️ What I love:  
🔥 Writing code so clean even future me won’t rage-quit.  
🎯 Making websites accessible because good design should **work for everyone**.  
🚀 Optimizing things just because “it could be faster.”  
☕ Consuming *probably* too much coffee while debugging the *one* thing that refuses to work.  

When I’m not coding, I’m either tweaking something *just a little more* or pretending to take a break.  

Let’s build something awesome! 🚀
